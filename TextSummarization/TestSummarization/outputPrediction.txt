the kyrgyz republic, a small, mountainous state of the former soviet republic, is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.
the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the german embassy, the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.
the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated.
the ink is sprayed on a person's left thumb.
at the entrance to each polling station, one election official will scan voter's fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter, and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot.
if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station.
the use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government.
the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink.
the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance.
local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful, radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems.
this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world, in countries as varied as serbia, south africa, indonesia and turkey.
the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink - but as the elections in afghanistan showed, improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems.
the use of "invisible" ink is not without its own problems.
however, in reality, the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off.
the ink stays on the finger for at least 72 hours and for up to a week.
the use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills.
